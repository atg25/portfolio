# Sprint 5 Plan: Data Visualization Dashboard Integration

**Goal:**
Rebuild the Data Visualization Dashboard as a local page within the portfolio, fully branded and consistent with the existing design system and documentation.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup

- [ ] Create a new page at `src/app/dataviz/page.tsx` for the dashboard.
- [ ] Add a navigation link to the dashboard in `main-nav.tsx`.

### 2. Branding & Layout

- [ ] Use existing layout, Card, Button, and other UI components for structure.
- [ ] Apply all relevant styles, typography, and color tokens from the design system.
- [ ] Ensure the dashboard is responsive and accessible.

### 3. Data Visualization

- [ ] Select and install a charting library (e.g., recharts or chart.js) if not already present.
- [ ] Build at least two interactive charts (e.g., bar, line, or pie) with sample data.
- [ ] Ensure charts use brand colors and accessible contrast.

### 4. Content & Features

- [ ] Add descriptive headings, labels, and tooltips for clarity.
- [ ] Include a summary or insights section above or below the charts.
- [ ] Add controls for filtering or changing the displayed data (if time allows).

### 5. Documentation & QA

- [ ] Update `docs/05-components.md` and `docs/06-implementation.md` to document the new dashboard page and any new components or patterns.
- [ ] Test for accessibility (keyboard, screen reader, color contrast).
- [ ] Test on mobile and desktop breakpoints.
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to ensure code quality.
