# Sprint 8 Plan: Programming Languages Ancestry Force Graph

## Objective

Design and implement an interactive force-directed graph demo that visualizes the ancestry and relationships of modern and historical programming languages. Integrate it as a new project in the portfolio with a live demo page.

## Goals

- Build a visually engaging, accessible force graph using React and react-force-graph.
- Allow users to explore language relationships, see details on hover, and interact with the graph.
- Ensure the demo is on-brand, responsive, and easy to extend.
- Document the process and update the portfolio project showcase.

## Tasks

1. **Requirements & Research**

   - Define user stories and acceptance criteria for the force graph demo.
   - Research programming language ancestry data and graph visualization best practices.
   - Design initial data structure (nodes/links) for the graph.

2. **Setup & Dependencies**

   - Scaffold a new page at `/force-graph-demo` in the app.
   - Install and configure `react-force-graph` and any supporting libraries.

3. **Data Modeling**

   - Create a JSON or JS data file representing languages and their relationships.
   - Include metadata for each language (year, creator, influences, etc.).

4. **Graph Implementation**

   - Render the force-directed graph with interactive nodes and links.
   - Add tooltips or side panel for language details on hover/click.
   - Style nodes/links by era, paradigm, or influence for clarity.
   - Add zoom, pan, and reset controls.

5. **Branding & UI Polish**

   - Apply portfolio design system: colors, typography, spacing, and accessibility.
   - Add a creative header, legend, and instructions for users.
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness and keyboard navigation.

6. **Integration & Documentation**

   - Add the project to `/projects` with a live demo link.
   - Document the implementation in `docs/05-components.md` and `docs/06-implementation.md`.
   - Write a short blog-style summary or walkthrough for the demo.

7. **Testing & QA**
   - Write unit and integration tests for the graph component (if feasible).
   - Test for accessibility, performance, and cross-device compatibility.
   - Gather feedback and iterate on the design.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

- As a user, I can explore a force-directed graph of programming languages and see how they are related.
- As a user, I can hover or click on a language to see details (name, year, influences, etc.).
- As a user, I can zoom, pan, and reset the graph view.
- As a user, I experience a visually engaging, accessible, and on-brand UI.

## Deliverables

- Live demo at `/force-graph-demo` with interactive force graph.
- Project entry in `/projects` with description and demo link.
- Updated documentation in `docs/05-components.md` and `docs/06-implementation.md`.
- Source data file for language relationships.

## Timeline

- **Week 1:** Research, data modeling, and initial setup
- **Week 2:** Graph implementation and UI polish
- **Week 3:** Testing, documentation, and final review
