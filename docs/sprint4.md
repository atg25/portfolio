# Sprint 4 Plan: Add GitHub and Live Demo Buttons to All Projects

## Objective

Ensure every project showcased on the Projects page includes clear, accessible buttons for both the GitHub repository and a live demo (if available), improving user experience and discoverability.

## Checklist

- [ ] Review all project cards in `src/app/projects/page.tsx`.
- [ ] For each project:
  - [ ] Add a **View on GitHub** button linking to the project's repository.
  - [ ] Add a **Live Demo** button linking to the deployed project (if available).
  - [ ] Use consistent button styles and placement for all projects.
  - [ ] Ensure all links open in a new tab and use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security.
- [ ] Update project descriptions if needed to clarify what users will find on GitHub or the live demo.
- [ ] Test all buttons to confirm they work and are accessible (keyboard, screen reader, etc).
- [ ] Review on mobile and desktop for responsive layout.
- [ ] Commit and push changes to GitHub.
- [ ] Update documentation if any new patterns or best practices are established.

## Notes

- If a project does not have a live demo, only include the GitHub button.
- If a project is not open source, clarify in the description or omit the GitHub button.
- Use the same button components and variants for a unified look.
