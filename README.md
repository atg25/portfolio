# Andrew Gardner Portfolio

[Live Site on Vercel](https://andrew-gardner-portfolio.vercel.app)

## Overview

This is a modern, fully responsive portfolio website for Andrew Gardner, built entirely with an AI autocoder (GitHub Copilot) and **zero handwritten code**. Every line, component, and feature was generated and refined using AI, demonstrating the power and reliability of next-generation coding tools.

## Key Features

- **LLM Chat Demo**: Interactive, multi-turn chat interface powered by OpenAI, with avatars, creative UI, and accessibility features.
- **Project Showcase**: Modular, filterable project cards with live demos, GitHub links, and learning reflections.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard**: Interactive charts and graphs (ComparisonChart, DonutChart, GrowthBarChart, etc.) using real and synthetic data.
- **Experience & Contact**: Clean, accessible, and on-brand pages for professional background and direct contact.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Desktop and mobile navigation with accessible dropdowns and drawers.
- **Consistent Design System**: All UI follows a custom design system (Creator archetype) for color, typography, spacing, and accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui** (Radix UI + Tailwind components)
- **Framer Motion** (animations)
- **OpenAI API** (LLM chat)
- **Vercel** (hosting)

## How It Works

- **No Handwritten Code**: All code was generated, edited, and refactored using GitHub Copilot and AI-driven workflows. This includes all pages, components, API routes, and styling.
- **Component System**: Uses shadcn/ui for all UI primitives, extended with custom ProjectCard and chart components.
- **Data Flow**: API routes in `/src/app/api` handle LLM chat and movie search, while data visualizations use local JSON.
- **Accessibility**: All components are tested for keyboard navigation, color contrast, and ARIA compliance.
- **Design System**: The project follows a documented system for color, typography, spacing, and layout (see `/docs`).
